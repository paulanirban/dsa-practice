## DSA - Intermediate

### **1. Find maximum consecutive ones possible by replacing 0 from a binary array**
> Given a binary array A[i] -> 0 or 1, find the maximum consecutive 1's we can get by replacing at least one 0 with a 1.

### **2. Matrix Subtraction**
> You are given two integer matrices A and B having same size(Both having same number of rows (N) and columns (M). You have to subtract matrix B from A and return the resultant matrix. (i.e. return the matrix A - B).
> 
> If A and B are two matrices of the same order (same dimensions). Then A - B is a matrix of the same order as A and B and its elements are obtained by doing an element wise subtraction of A from B.

### **3. Multiple Left Rotation**
> Given an array of integers A and multiple values in B, which represents the number of times array A needs to be left rotated.
>
> Find the rotated array for each value and return the result in the form of a matrix where ith row represents the rotated array for the ith value in B.
