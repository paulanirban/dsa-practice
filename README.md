## DSA - Beginner

### 1. Easy HCF
> Write a program to input two integers A & B from user and print their HCF. 
> Definition Of HCF: The HCF(Highest Common Factor) or the GCD(greatest common divisor) of two 
> positive integers happens to be the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without leaving a remainder.
>
> Note : this is non-recursive way

## DSA - Intermediate

### **1. Find maximum consecutive ones possible by replacing 0 from a binary array**
> Given a binary array A[i] -> 0 or 1, find the maximum consecutive 1's we can get by replacing at least one 0 with a 1.

### **2. Matrix Subtraction**
> You are given two integer matrices A and B having same size(Both having same number of rows (N) and columns (M). You have to subtract matrix B from A and return the resultant matrix. (i.e. return the matrix A - B).
> 
> If A and B are two matrices of the same order (same dimensions). Then A - B is a matrix of the same order as A and B and its elements are obtained by doing an element wise subtraction of A from B.

### **3. Multiple Left Rotation**
> Given an array of integers A and multiple values in B, which represents the number of times array A needs to be left rotated.
>
> Find the rotated array for each value and return the result in the form of a matrix where ith row represents the rotated array for the ith value in B.

### **4. Amazing Sub Strings**
> You are given a string S, and you have to find all the amazing substrings of S. 
> An amazing Substring is one that starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U).

### **5. Josephus Problem**
> There are A people standing in a circle. Person 1 kills their immediate clockwise neighbour and 
> pass the knife to the next person standing in circle. This process continues till there is only 1 
> person remaining. Find the last person standing in the circle.

### **6. Count Pair**
> Given a character array, count the number of pairs (i, j) possible s.t. i<j and a[i]='a' and a[j]='g'.
> 
> Note : All characters are of lowercase
